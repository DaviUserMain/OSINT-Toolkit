# My OSINT Toolkit

This repository is a curated collection of my favorite and most useful Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools. The goal is to organize knowledge and maintain a quick reference guide for different types of investigations.

### üåê General Frameworks and Platforms
*Platforms that aggregate multiple OSINT tools and techniques.*

* **[OSINT] Framework](https://osintframework.com/)**: An interactive web framework that organizes a huge number of OSINT tools by category. It's the best starting point for any investigation, helping you find the right tool for each type of data.
* **[Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/)**: A powerful data visualization tool that graphically maps the relationships between different pieces of information (people, emails, domains, companies). Excellent for discovering hidden connections.

### üë§ Username Analysis
*Tools for finding user profiles on multiple platforms.*

* **[Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock)**: A powerful Python script that searches for a username across hundreds of social networks. Essential for starting any person-focused investigation. * **[WhatsMyName](https://whatsmyname.app/)**: A web service that also checks the existence of a username on various websites, with a visual and easy-to-use interface.

### üñ•Ô∏è Domain and IP Address Analysis
*Tools for collecting information about websites, servers, and network infrastructure.*

* **[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/)**: Known as the "search engine for internet-connected devices." It allows you to find servers, webcams, routers, and much more.
* **[theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester)**: An excellent tool for collecting emails, subdomains, hosts, and employee names related to a domain.
* **[ViewDNS.info](https://viewdns.info/)**: An aggregator of online network tools. Offers services like Reverse IP Lookup, Whois, IP History, and many more in one place.

### üì± Social Media Analysis
*Specific tools for extracting and analyzing social media data.*

* **[Social Blade](https://socialblade.com/)**: Analyzes statistics from social media profiles (YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, etc.). Great for checking profile growth, engagement, and identifying potential bot activity.
* **[TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/)**: An official Twitter dashboard that allows you to monitor multiple users, hashtags, and keywords in real time in columns. Essential for following live events.

### üó∫Ô∏è Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT)
*Tools for extracting information from geographic data.*

* **[Google Earth Pro](https://www.google.com/earth/versions/#earth-pro)**: Allows you to view historical satellite imagery, measure distances, and visualize terrain in 3D. Essential for physical analysis of locations.
* **[Wikimapia](http://wikimapia.org/)**: A collaborative map that often contains information about sensitive or specific locations not found on conventional maps.
* **[FlightRadar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/)**: Real-time commercial flight tracking, useful for investigations involving travel or events.

### üìÑ Metadata Analysis
*Tools for extracting hidden information from files (images, documents, etc.).*

* **[ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/)**: The ultimate metadata tool. A command-line program that reads, writes, and edits metadata from a wide range of files.
* **[FOCA (Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives)](https://www.elevenpaths.com/labstools/foca/)**: Automates the search for documents in a domain and extracts metadata from them, helping to map the internal structure of an organization.# My OSINT Toolkit
